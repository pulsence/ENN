Save Tool
This tool allows you to save settings and topology to file
The command takes another command, -s or -t to determine what is being
saved.

-s refers to settings and -t refers to topology
For -t also add -n {name of topology} to save a specific topology. If this
is not included then no topologies will be saved.

The commands also takes another command -f which specifies the file
location. They also take the -b flag which when added tells the tool to
create a binary file. If this is not included then a binary or text file
is created based upon the file extention.

Note: if -f is not specified a stock name is used and the file is saved in
either the Settings or Topologies folder.

Examples:
-s -s
-s -s -f C:\\ENN\\Settings\\mySettings.nnsc -b
-s -t -n mainTopology -f C:\\ENN\\Topologies\\mainTopology.nnt
